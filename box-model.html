            <u> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</u>
            <br/>
            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (ISO: Mōhanadāsa Karamacaṁda Gāṁdhī;[c] 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an
            Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead
            the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights
            and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied
            to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.[2]

            Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in
            London and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where
            he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an
            Indian merchant in a lawsuit.
